I never have not left computer since I knew myself.
My uncle is an computer engineer. Since I was very fond of the structures I saw
on my uncle's screen when I was little, I started with personal projects that
would make me happy in this sector. and I continue. I like to be challenged in
what I love because I learn as I get more difficult, I am happy as I learn.
I've been very insecure at times. That's why I left saying I hate software. I filled
my void again with software. The relationship between us is difficult to explain.
I started coding with C#. After laying the foundations and developing a project
on my own, I continued with javascript and strengthened my frontend and
dynamic infrastructure. My first real work experience was playing a role as a
fullstack in an international crm project. I worked there with really experienced
people. The information I got from them helped me a lot to prove myself in

Turkey. Scott Pachunka was a good interface designer, but he did it with ready-
made applications. I myself prefer to write in core. I've never chased after a

library, no matter how advanced technology is, it's hard to trust. because it is
always changing. only, change itself does not change. At that time, I progressed
with robotic coding. Then I worked frontend and database in a health clinic.
Then I took projects from outside and developed it and made additions from
the beginning as a fullstack.
I graduated from computer programming department 2021- on September.
I studied in Çankırı, but I studied myself to learn. School didn't do anything for
me.
I developed dashboard, crm, finance applications with python; web,
dashboard, crm, finance applications with javascript;
Method changes used in data capture with php;
Now, I want to learn more thing. Because it is necessary to be at work place to
learn. I am clear to learn and develop. So I deserve a chance. Not much, a
chance. Chance, everyone deserves.
